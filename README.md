# Lottery Challenge

This is the code for my lottery challenge.

_Instructions_

- `npm i` to install packages
- make sure `nodemon` is installed in the main folder
- run `npm run dev` to start the app!

This app is concurrent, therefore `npm run dev` runs both the back-end and front-end simultaneously.

Enjoy!
